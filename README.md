The application is built using Django.

````
# For Windows

source venv/bin/activate
````

make run
````

## Environment Variables for CSV Import

To import the remote CSV files (using HTTP authentication), set the following environment variablesâ€¯:

- `BEST_HOTEL_USERNAME` : HTTP username
- `BEST_HOTEL_PASSWORD` : HTTP password

Example (macOS/Linux):
```zsh
export BEST_HOTEL_USERNAME="your-username"
export BEST_HOTEL_PASSWORD="your-password"
```

If these variables are not set, you will be prompted for them when running the import command.

## Automated Daily Import (Cron job)

This project uses [django-crontab](https://github.com/kraiz/django-crontab) to schedule the daily import of hotel and city data from remote CSV files.

- The import runs every day at 2:00 AM automatically.
- The cron job is registered automatically when you run `make run`.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure your environment variables `BEST_HOTEL_USERNAME` and `BEST_HOTEL_PASSWORD` are set in the environment where the cron runs.
